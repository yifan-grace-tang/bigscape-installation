`brew` is a package manager for Mac which means in laymans term that it more easily installs missing softwares from your computer that are required later in the installation pipeline. While not explicitely required it will massively ease the process later on when certain commands are missing from your machine. The main installation guide is available [here](https://brew.sh) but first reference the instructions below.

</details>
