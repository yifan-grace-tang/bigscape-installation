<h1> Installation Guide </h1>

__Please read through this entire guide before getting started as it will save you a lot of time troubleshooting errors later on__. 

Even if you have never installed similar softwares on your computer before, you should be able to install BiG-SCAPE _as long as you read this guide thoroughly_.

## Installation Steps

Follow the links for your platform __do not use Windows instructions for Mac or vice-versa__. These steps are _dependent on each other_ so follow them sequentially.

For __Mac__:

1. [üçª Brew Installation](#-brew-installation-mac)
2. [üêç Miniconda Installation](#-miniconda-installation-mac)
3. [‚öôÔ∏è BiG-SCAPE Installation](#%EF%B8%8F-big-scape-installation-mac)

For __Windows__:

1. [üêß WSL Installation](#-wsl-installation-windows)
2. [üêç Miniconda Installation](#-miniconda-installation-windows)
3. [‚öôÔ∏è BiG-SCAPE Installation](#%EF%B8%8F-big-scape-installation-windows)

## Terminal, Powershell, and Ubuntu

For __Mac__ based installation instructions you will exclusively be using the `terminal` application to interact with your computer.

For __Windows__ based installation instructions you will be using both `PowerShell` and `ubuntu` at any given step.

## "How To Use" This Guide

- Unless otherwise specified, use the copy button feature on GitHub __ONLY__, do not attempt to manually type commands into your terminal or powershell.

- When editing text in the terminal window you __cannot highlight__ a particular area __and delete__ with your keyboard. Instead to delete a portion of your command you must use your left arrow and navigate to the portion you want to edit

- If commands are expected to take a long time to complete they will be indicated with this icon ‚åõ. This means that either you should wait until a confirmation/continue action or wait until you can type again. You should see something like this when you are able to type again:

__For Macbook Pro__
```
(base) username@your-mbp ~ % |
```
__For Macbook Air__
```
(base) username@your-air ~ % |
```

__For a Windows Computer (Powershell)__
```
PS C:\Users\username> |
```

__For a Windows Computer (Ubuntu)__
```
(base) username@Name:~$ |
```

# Mac Based Installation

Follow these instructions __only__ if you are using a Mac. The expectation is that you first do `brew` installation, then `conda` installation, and finally `bigscape` installation.

## üçª Brew Installation (Mac)

<p align="center">
  <img src="./img/brew-installation.gif" width="700"/> 
</p>

```bash
brew -v
```

2) If `brew` is already installed, you will see a message similar to the one below (versions can differ). Proceed to the [Miniconda Installation](#-miniconda-installation-mac) section.

```bash
Homebrew 4.3.7
```

3) If you see the message below - proceed to step 4:

```bash
zsh: command not found: brew
```

4) ‚åõ Copy and paste the following command into your `terminal` and click `return`:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

between 4 and 5 you have to add press enter

5) When prompted for your __password__ as seen below, type your computer login password.

<p align="center">

6) ‚åõ The installation will ask you to click `return` to continue:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./img/brew_mac_return_or_enter.png" height="60">
</p>


7) Paste into your terminal - replace `bigscape` with your username - the command is explicitly printed by the brew installation during the mention of __next steps__:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./img/brew_mac_next_steps.png" height="80">
</p>

```bash
 (echo; echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"') >> /Users/bigscape/.zprofile
```

8) Paste into your terminal:

```bash
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

9) Check if `brew` is successfully installed on your computer. Paste:

```bash
brew -v
```
