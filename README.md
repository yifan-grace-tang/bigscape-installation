# BiG-SCAPE Installation Guide

![Big-SCAPE Logo](https://bigscape-corason.secondarymetabolites.org/images/bigscape.png)

__Please read through this entire guide before getting started as it will save you a lot of time troubleshooting errors later on__. 

Even if you have never installed similar softwares on your computer before, you should be able to install BiG-SCAPE _as long as you read this guide thoroughly_.

## Before You Get Started

- Unless otherwise specified, use the copy button feature on GitHub __ONLY__, do not attempt to manually type commands into your terminal.

- If commands are expected to take a long time to complete they will be indicated with this icon ‚åõ. This means that either you should wait until a confirmation/continue action or wait until you can type again. You should see something like this when you are able to type again:

__For Macbook Pro__
```
(base) username@your-mbp ~ % |
```
__For Macbook Air__
```
(base) username@your-air ~ % |
```

- When editing text in the terminal window you __cannot highlight__ a particular area __and delete__ with your keyboard. Instead to delete a portion of your command you must use your left arrow and navigate to the portion you want to edit

## Installation Steps

Follow the links for your platform __do not use Windows instructions for Mac or vice-versa__. These steps are _dependent on each other_ so follow them sequentially.

For __Mac__:

1. [Brew Installation](#-brew-installation-mac)
2. [Miniconda Installation](#-miniconda-installation-mac)
3. [BiG-SCAPE Installation](#%EF%B8%8F-big-scape-installation-mac)

For __Windows__:

1. [WSL Installation]()
2. [Brew Installation]()
3. [Miniconda Installation]()
4. [BiG-SCAPE Installation]()

# Mac Based Installation

Follow these instructions __only__ if you are using a Mac. The expectation is that you first do `brew` installation, then `conda` installation, and finally `bigscape` installation.

## üçª Brew Installation (Mac)

1) Check if `brew` is already installed on your computer. Open your `terminal` <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Terminalicon2.png/240px-Terminalicon2.png" width="20" height="20" align="center"/> application and paste into your terminal:

```bash
brew -v
```

2) If `brew` is already installed, you will see a message similar to the one below (versions can differ). Proceed to the [Miniconda Installation](#-miniconda-installation-mac) section.

```bash
Homebrew 4.3.7
```

3) If you see the message below - proceed to step 4:

```bash
zsh: command not found: brew
```

4) ‚åõ Copy and paste the following command into your `terminal` and click `return`:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

5) When prompted for your __password__ as seen below, type your computer login password.

</p>

> [!NOTE]
> You will not be able to see the information you type, so just type your password and click return 

6) Paste into your terminal:

```bash
(echo; echo "eval \"\$($(brew --prefix)/bin/brew shellenv)\"") >> /Users/$USER/.zprofile
```

7) Paste into your terminal:
```bash
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

8) Check if `brew` is successfully installed on your computer. Paste:

```bash
brew -v
```

9) If `brew` is successfully installed, you will see a message similar to the one below (versions can differ). Proceed to the [Miniconda Installation](#-miniconda-installation-mac) section.

```bash
Homebrew 4.3.7
```
 
## üêç Miniconda Installation (Mac)

> [!WARNING]  
> __Follow the file download instructions very carefully! If you don't download the right file, there will be lots of troubleshooting.__

> [!NOTE]
> Miniconda is also refered to as `conda` and those terms will be used interchangibly in this installation guide.

1) Check if conda is already installed on your computer. Paste in your `terminal` <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Terminalicon2.png/240px-Terminalicon2.png" width="20" height="20" align="center"/> :

```bash
conda -V
```

2) If the `conda` is already installed, you will see a message similar to the one below (versions can differ). Proceed to the [BiG-SCAPE Installation](#%EF%B8%8F-big-scape-installation-mac) section.

```bash
conda 24.5.0
```

3) If the `conda` is __not__ installed, then you will see the message below - proceed to step 4:

```bash
zsh: command not found: conda
```

4) Navigate to [this link](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/#latest-miniconda-installer-links) and download the installer version as specificied in the images __DO NOT SELECT ANY OTHER INSTALLER__. Click the link under the _Name_ field to begin installation

<p align="center">
  <img src="./img/correct-miniconda-install.png" height="500">
</p>
   

5) Open a new `terminal` window and copy-paste the command below:

```bash
cd downloads
```
 
6) ‚åõ Paste into your terminal:

```bash
bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
```

7) You will now be prompted for a series of agreements that you must accept from your terminal. These are included below:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./img/conda-64bit-accept-small.png" height="99">
  <br>
  <em>Here type the word 'yes' and click enter </em>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="./img/conda-tos.png" height="283">
  <br>
  <em>When you see the Terms of Service (TOS) use your down arrow key to get through the text</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="./img/conda-tos-accept.png" height="107">
   <br>
  <em>After you finish scrolling through the TOS type the word 'yes' to move on</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="./img/conda-install-accept-small.png" height="146">
   <br>
  <em>Complete the installation by clicking the 'return' key</em>  
</p>

8) Close your `terminal` window and open a __new__ `terminal` window.

9) Check if conda is successfully installed on your computer. Paste in your `terminal`:

```bash
conda -V
```

10) If the `conda` is sucessfully installed, you will see a message similar to the one below (versions can differ). Proceed to the [BiG-SCAPE Installation](#%EF%B8%8F-big-scape-installation-mac) section.

```bash
conda 24.5.0
```
